# main app
- stamps
- fix url being annoying
- dont close items on pick
- highlight available collabs when basic item is picked
- enforce max number of collabs (4 collab + 1 weapon)
- leave the X button visible to remove an item
- drag and drop items maybe
- get the new idols sprites

# admin app
- pretty much everything
- try json-server https://github.com/typicode/json-server (probably easier/faster than trpc + lokijs) or keep trpc and use lowdb directly https://github.com/typicode/lowdb
